The original estimate was that Visa was 1000x faster than Bitcoin, but that was based on the old estimate of 7 transactions per second from Bitcoin. Mike Hearn now estimates that Bitcoin can handle just 3 transactions per second in practice, so Visa is more like 2000x faster than Bitcoin.

A sneak preview: if a mining pool accumulates a majority of the network’s computing power (not unlikely, given how big the top few pools are), they could mount a 51% attack and rewrite the blockchain to give themselves unlimited funds.
If a group of Bitcoin users with a majority of the network’s total computing power agree, they can make a “hard fork” of the blockchain by going back to the transaction before the theft and creating a new “branch” of the blockchain. New blocks would now be placed on a new branch, effectively making all transactions on the old branch null and void. This has been done before, but it’s always highly controversial.
